Every

be
a
half
day

Took
the
afternoon
off
to
hit
the
dentist
","
and
while
I
wa
out
I
managed
to
get
my
oil
changed

Remember
that
business
with
my
car
dealership
this
winter
?
Well
","
consider
this
the
epilogue

The
friendly
fella
at
the
Valvoline
Instant
Oil
Change
on
Snelling
were
nice
enough
to
notice
that
my
dipstick
wa
broken
","
and
the
metal
piece
wa
too
far
down
in
it
little
dipstick
tube
to
pull
out

'm
going

Today
I
let
my
bos
know
that
I
've
submitted
my
Corps
application
.
The
news
ha
been
greeted
by
everyone
in
the
company
with
a
level
of
enthusiasm
that
really
floor
me
.
The
back
deck
ha
finally
been
cleared
off
by
the
construction
company
working
on
the
place
.
This
company
","
for
anyone
who
's
interested
","
consists
mainly
of
one
guy
who
spends
his
day
cursing
at
his
crew
of
Spanish-speaking
laborer

Construction
of
my
deck
began
around

Nixon

getting
out

I

myself

going

office

Cry
for
me

Oh
well

I
think
hitting
the
submit

my

tomorrow
might
actually
make
that
return
bearable
.

I
'm
still
not
making
any
headway
with
my
family

In
fact

I
think
Mom
ha
been
rallying
the
troop
(
aka
aunt

uncle
)
against
me

Meanwhile
","
my
friend
have
been
really
supportive
of
the
idea

Thanks
","
all

It
's
frustrating
","
you
know
?
Here
","
I
want
to
get
out
into
the
world
","
have
a
pinch
of
adventure
","
and
maybe
help
some
people
out
in
the
process
","
and
I
'm
earning
the
resentment
of
the
entire
freakin
'
family
because
of
this
.
I
can
only
hope
that
","
over
time
","
cooler
head
will
prevail

There
's
now
a
nationwide
girlfriend
hunt
on
for
yours
truly
(
hell
","
with
Mom
's
Mexico

","
this
shit

go
international

","
because
","
obviously
","
the
cure
for
all
this
foolishness
is
for
me
to
get
laid
.
Oh
","
and
I
should
buy
myself
something
nice

Problem
solved

Life
is
so
sad

Had
a
spot
of
Sunday
night
insomnia
","
fueled
mostly
by
my
discussion
with
the
parent
yesterday

Thankfully

Jack
Daniels

me
out

Whoever

Two
point
for

Back
to
About

moment

I
just
love
the

Schmidt

Does
anyone

the

way

So
many
superfluous
letter

that
kooky
``

that

Along
those

it

Michael

we
end
up

me

About
Schmidt
this
afternoon
.
Pretty
good
.
A
little
vexed
by
the
ending
.
I
think
I
'm
getting
too
lazy
to
interpret
ambiguity
.
Finished
up
most
of
my
application
today
","
essay
question
and
all
.
All
that
remains
is
to
inform
my
reference
of
their
reference
status
...
and
that
could
very
well
mean
letting
my
company
know
that
I
'm
planning
to
leave
in
6
mo
.
to
a
year
.
I
'm
not
sure
how
they
'll
react
","
but
I
'm
not
all
that
concerned
","
either
.
Good
people
there
","
certainly
","
but
I
am
giving
them
at
least
six
month
notice
.
At
this
point
","
the
only
thing
that
give
me
pause
is
Sydney
.
I
have
to
make
sure
she
ha
a
home
for
a
few
year
","
and
I
have
to
be
sure
that
whoever
get
her
know
what
they
're
getting
into
.
Sydney
's
a
good
cat
in
a
lot
of
way
...
very
clean
","
very
well
mannered
","
sweet
a
all
get
out
...
and
that
tiny
meow
.
That
said
","
she
like
to
scratch
stuff
","
and
I
should
probably
get
that
in
check
before
I
expose
her
to
furniture
that
is
n't
dorm-rated
.
para1
I
spent
a
good
hour
last
night
paging
through
the
application
and
making
little
note
about
what
to
say
for
the
longer
","
essay
portion
.
The
question
being
asked
are
standard
job
interview
stuff
","
at
least
they
were
at
the
University
.
Basically
","
how
do
you
handle
diversity
","
and
why
do
you
want
to
work
here
?
As
for
the
short
answer
:
I
have
n't
decided
whether
I
should
be
concerned
by
the
fact
that
there
's
an
entire
page
dedicated
to
previous
volunteer
experience
...
and
","
apart
from
a
pledge
that
I
'm
going
to
be
doing
some
tutoring
work
for
the
Minnesota
Literacy
Council
","
that
page
is
going
to
be
completely
blank
.
The
job
history
page
say
to
go
back
``
at
least
10
year

Ten
year
ago

I
wa
16

I
wa
working
at
Best

and
I
hated
it

I
should
note
","
though
","
that
I
saw
my
old
manager
working
at
Audio
King
(
back
when
it
wa
called

King

many
month

Then
there

I
ca
n't
believe
that
an
international
aid
organization
would
find
my
ability
to
upsell
Packard
Bells
","
or
say
in
what
section
Femalien
resides
","
remotely
interesting

How
I
spent
the
remainder
of
my
Thursday
night
:
Watched
The
Fog
of
War
","
an
amazing
Errol
Morris
doc
about
Robert
McNamara

Then
","
I
went
to
sleep

had
strange
dream

Holly
Hunter

It
's
pretty
obvious
that
I

great
learner

I

I
've
been
feeling
more
than
a
little
anxious
the
past
few

Life
a
a
web
developer
ha
sort

burned
me
out

I
think
I

like
to
try
something
different

something
that
will
get
me
closer
the
Great
Life
Goal
I
'm
shooting
for

I
'm
not

what
the
Goal
is
exactly
","
but
I
get
the
feeling
I
'll
never
get
there
on
my
current
course

Web
development
is
great

all
","
but
sometimes
I
get
the
impression

","
in
this
field
","
I
'm
driven
more
by
my
perfectionism
than
by
any
genuine
love
of
the
work

It
's
no
secret
to
anyone
that
's
spoken
to
me
in
the
past
few
month
that
I
'm
about
this
(

close
to
joining
the
Peace
Corps

In
fact
","
the
application
is
sitting
on
my
coffee
table
right
now

There
's
a
pen
there
","
too

Oh
","
and
I
've
filled
in
a
few
blank
with
that
very
same
pen

There
are
a
few
very
big
blank
that
are
going
to
demand
more
brainpower
than
I
can
muster
after
8-something
hour
of
mind-numbing
development

but
I
promise
you
that
I
'm
going
to
power
through

get
all
16+

the
form

the

I

even

be
able

hear
my

she
hears

So

a

I
'm

here
we
go
.
para1
My
reference
form
trickled
in
last

and
that
left
the
weekend
for
me
to
buck
up
my
cross-cultural
adaptation
essay
","
something
I
've
been
really
struggling
with
.
What
's
a
significant
experience
you
've
had
with
adapting
to
a
different
culture
?
You
'd
think
that
a
three
month
stint
in
Europe
would
make
a
question
of
this
kind
really
easy
to
answer

but
it
doe

tourism
","
a
it
turn
out
","
doe
n't
really
lend
itself
to
forcing
you
adapt
to
anything
other
than
washing
your
clothes
in
a
sink
.
I
wish
I
could
say
I
've
needed
to
wipe
my
butt
with
a
leaf
once
in
my
life
","
but
that
's
just
not
the
case
...
hence
","
my
application
to
the
PC
.
Back
to
the
story
","
then
.
I
filled
up
the
huge
PC
envelope
last
night
and
sent
it
on
it
way
this
morning
.
There
's
an
education
addendum
that
I
decided
against
filling
out
","
only
because
it
would
have
been
a
pretty
pathetic-looking
effort
.
My
IT
addendum
","
on
the
other
hand

wa
five

long

Huzzah

I
'd
still
rather
not
spend
two
year
sitting
in
front
of
a
computer
in
Whateverstan
","
but
I
do
n't
want
to
limit
my
placement
opportunity

either

So
that
's
that

Now
I
wait
for
a
nomination

On
the

This

I
told
them
that
I
've
submitted

Their

They

Still

Dad
say
that
I
'm
making
a
mistake

and
Mom
said
she

(
``
I
'm
bad
!

.
``
Final
Fight
''
still
seems
decent
","
and
thankfully
show
that
not
all
of
those
precious
quarter
were
wasted
.
Ahh
","
to
be
back
in
the
K-mart
arcade
playing
``
Altered
Beast
''
and
``
Time
Warriors
''
...
Sunday
","
I
sat
around
some
more
.
While
everyone
else
wa
watching
firework
","
I
wa
sitting
through
``
Fahrenheit
9-11
''
.
In
a
nutshell
:
I
loved
the
first
ten
minute
","
including
the
minimalist
title
sequence
","
and
the
eerie
handling
of
9-11
.
Moore
's
naked
contempt
for
G.W
.
is
palatable
when
it
's
merely
being
insinuated
.
It
's
le
so
when
he
refers
to
G.H.W
.
Bush
a
G.W
.
's
``
daddy
''
...
but
then
I
guess
that
's
what
political
discourse
ha
become
in
this
country
.
As
with
``
Bowling
for
Columbine
''
","
Moore
's
film
is
most
effective
when
read
at
arm
's
length
.
Many
of
his
fact
are
incorrect
","
and
the
thing
he
infers
can
be
completely
unfair
","
but
some
of
the
broader
stroke
(
such
a
our
cozy
relationship
with
Saudi
Arabia
","
or
the
increased
fear-mongering
of
the
medium
in
the
past
few
year
)
invite
discussion
","
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
.
Wild

Got
a
big
pack
of
PC
form
in
the
mail
yesterday
","
including
a
few
for
my
fingerprint
.
With
luck
","
I
'll
get
an
interview
scheduled
this
week
or
next
.
How
are
you
doing
?
I
'm
so
happy
to
hear
that
!
Not
feeling
terribly
motivated
to
get
outside
for
some
firework
this
evening
.
I
've
been
dead
tired
all
day
","
to
tell
you
the
truth
.
Spent
some
time
out
at
my
parent
'
place
today
","
but
Peace
Corps
did
n't
make
the
meeting
agenda
","
so
the
Big
News
will
have
to
wait
a
week
.
Signed
up
for
Google
News
Alerts
about
the
Peace
Corps
today
","
just
to
keep
my
eye
on
thing
.
Bleh
","
I
ca
n't
seem
to
eat
anything
that
agrees
with
me
these
past
few
week
.
I
wonder
if
I
have
a
parasite

E-mail
from
